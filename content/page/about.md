### Adwin Nugroho Siswoyo

You can call me Adwin, born and raised at Samarinda, Indonesia. Currently I working at **Diacon Medica Technologies** as a backend developer. I graduated from University of Muhammadiyah Malang with a bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering. My first project as a software engineer was create an cashier and online booking system with Visual Basic 6.0.

During college I was actively participated in competitions in the field of tech such as **Program Kreativitas Mahasiswa, Gemastik**.
I really like the topic of research on health informatics, I always dreaming can help people, although I'm not a doctor. Now i'm just focusing on microservices, web development with GoLang, and sometimes do random stuff with python and R for data science.


Here are a few technologies mostly I use on daily basis:
